Resources
	Air charge
		Determines availability of second jump or air boost when in the air, resets upon ground state

States
	Ground
		Idle {}
			On the ground not moving
		Run {left OR right}
			On the ground holding left or right
		Punch {punch}
			Hurting things
		Jump {jump}
			Jumping off the ground and into the air
		Dash {dash}
			Instantly redirects velocity left or right
		Boost {dash(hold)}
			Accelerates left or right, retains momentum at higher speeds
		Slope Boost {down AND dash(hold) AND on slope}
			Much faster than regular boosting if on a slope
		
	Air
		Idle {left OR right OR nothing}
			In the air, with some air control with left or right
		Punch {punch}
			Hurting things
		Boost {dash(hold)}
			Accelerates left or right
		Dash {dash AND HAS air charge}
			Instantly moves left or right, zeroes y-velocity, consumes air charge
		Jump {jump AND HAS air charge}
			Jumping further into the air, consumes air charge
		Down Boost {down AND dash}
			Accelerates downwards, for bombing a slope
			
	Wall
		Cling {}
			Holds onto a wall, slowly slides down. two poses for clinging before/after a wall boost
		Jump {jump}
			Jumps off wall
		Dash {dash AND (NOT up)}
			Dashes off wall
		Boost {up AND (dash OR dash(hold))}
			Runs up wall, can transition into if you ground boost up a slope into the wall (this can allow you to go very high up the wall)
		Down Boost (ungrabs) {down AND dash}
			ungrabs into a air down boost
		Ungrab {left away from wall OR right away from wall}
			Releases the wall, into air idle
