States
	Ground
		Idle {}
			On the ground not moving
		Run {left OR right}

		Punch {punch}
			Hurting things
		Jump {jump}
			Jumping off the ground and into the air
		Dash {dash}

		Punch {punch}
			Hurting things
		Boost {dash(hold)}
			Accelerates left or right
		Dash {dash AND HAS air charge}
			Instantly accelerates left or right, zeroes y-velocity, consumes air charge
		Jump {jump AND HAS air charge}
			Jumping further into the air, consumes air charge
		Down Dash {down AND dash AND vel.y >= 0}
			Instantly accelerates down
		Down Boost {down AND dash(hold)}
			Accelerates downwards, for bombing a slope
