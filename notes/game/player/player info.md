## concepts

#### Boost
Boosts are the main movement mechanic of the game. Boosting provides a burst of speed to the player, as well as elimate the players normal limits for speed. On its own, the speed boost doesn't do much, but is very powerful when exploiting the level. It can be used to convert falling speed into horizontal speed and horizontal speed in upward speed, using sloped surfaces.

#### Boost Sustain
Boosting normally only lasts 0.30 seconds, but holding the boost input after the boost expires lets the player continue boosting at their current speed. 

In the air, the player can use the sustain to influence their aerial movement, by "turning" the boost in any 8 directions. This applies acceleration in this direction. Unlike regular boosting, the player is subject to gravity, though sustaining upwards can reduce its influence.

On the ground, sustain lets the player continue to travel at their current speed across the ground. Speed is retained across slopes, letting them turn falling momentum into upward momentum if the level design allows it. Can turn around while boost sustain on the ground but its slow.

Boosts & Sustains can also be done up/down wall and even across ceilings if fast enough.

## player resources

#### Boost
Not really sure how this is managed yet, just that the player's boost should probably be limited somehow, so they can't just boost forever.
- Preferrably not a meter
- Should be intuitive somehow
- Attacks probably also use this

**Ideas:**
1. Upon boosting a circle outline appears, slowly shrinking over time, player can't boost again until they exit the circle. circle size depends on the current speed. Can keep boosting so long as you're going fast
2. Just make it a charge like dustforce or celeste?
3. No restrictions (Anarchy mode)
