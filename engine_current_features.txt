based on SDL + opengl
compiles to windows, linux, probably mac (haven't tried) and web (via emscripten)

core:
	math utilities
	custom containers
	custom smart pointers

	engine loop fixed updates and lerped rendering between updates
		fixed update allow deterministic gameplay
		lerped rendered allows unlimited framerate without effecting determinism
	input handling with buffering and input mapping
	state engine with extensible states
	configurable update rate and draw rate, supports vertical sync
	
render
	wraps opengl implementation
	basic shape rendering
	textures and render textures
	window/render target handler

	textures
	animated sprites and tilemaps
	
resource
	deserialization of assets (levels, animations, textures, fonts)
	serialization of assets (currently broken lmao)
	automatic hot-reload of levels, textures, animations, fonts if newer file detected
	levels made with Tiled
	
game
	pseudo-implementation of ECS
	systems:
		Camera 		- multiple camera targets and camera behavior
		Collision - custom-made collision system for platforming, supports slopes and moving platforms/tilemaps
		Level 		- level tilemaps, scrolling, parallax, custom logic for certain types of tiles (such as animations or treadmills)
		Object 		- updating gameobjects with custom behavior (i.e. the player)
